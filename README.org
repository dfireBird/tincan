* Protocol Used
** Handshake
Before any of the following messgaes a handshake that must have **8 bytes** of following format must be sent:
=Hello<id>=
=<id>= is 4 byte integer which uniquiely identifies that peer and must be generated at the start of application.

If that's succesful the other peer should respond with a message with format =Hello<id>=
=<id>= should be the same as the one received if not handshake is not completed and we should discard the connection.

** Virtual Headers
All of the messages contain a virtual header of *8 bytes* followed the messages content that has a maximum size of *2048 bytes*.
All virtual headers have the following format:
 =<msg_type><length_of_msg>=
=msg_type= is the type of message that's being sent or received, occupies 4 bytes of header.
=length_of_msg= is the total length of message content that being sent or received, occupies remaining 4 bytes of header.
** Types of Messages
+ Chat Message
=msg_type= of the chat messages are =chat= and it's followed the by the length of chat message being sent or received, 
padded with zeroes in front to occupy 4 bytes

+ File Transfer
=msg_type= of the file transfer messages are =file= and it's followed by the length of the file being sent and received, 
padded with zeroes, like the chat message.
